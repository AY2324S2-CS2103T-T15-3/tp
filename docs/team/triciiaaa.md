### Project: BandBook

BandBook is a desktop band contact and attendance management application optimised for CLI users. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 4 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to assign an instrument to a person.
  * What it does: allows the band administrator to assign an instrument to one or more people in one command. 
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the band administrator to easily manage the band members' instruments and coordinate performance rehearsals.
  * Highlights: This enhancement also utilises the instrument field `i/` to assign instruments to people.
  * Credits: This feature was built upon the existing `edit` command.
