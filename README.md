# BandBook

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

## About the App

BandBook is your all-in-one software designed to streamline the management of band members' contact details and
attendance. Optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), BandBook can assist you in managing your members' details
faster than traditional GUI apps.

  * It is **written in OOP fashion** and provides a **reasonably well-written** code base.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

## Main Features
It offers a user-friendly platform to **add, edit and delete members' contact information**,
along with optional fields such as **tag, birthday, matriculation year and instrument information**.

Moreover, you can **assign instruments** to your members and **find your members by their name and/or instrument
assigned**. You may also **indicate and view the attendance history of your members**, ensuring that they stay on
track with the band's activities.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `bandbook.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for BandBook.
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar bandbook.jar`
   command to run the application.
